                    Drowning and scalds are the two main risks with bath time. You can avoid these risks by following
the four golden rules for safe bath times:

Always supervise babies, toddlers and children under five years in the bath. Never leave older
children or siblings to supervise. They don’t have the skills to see and react to an emergency
situation.
Check the water temperature is between 37°C and 38°C before you put your child in. Use a water
thermometer or your wrist or your elbow.
Get everything ready in advance so you can stay with your child for bath time – towel, face washer,
cotton wool, clean nappy and clean clothes.
Let the water out as soon as bath time is over. About 5-10 minutes is long enough for a baby bath.

    Drowning is one of the major causes of death for children under five years.

Very young children are prone to drowning. This is because they’re top-heavy. They can slip into or
under the water very suddenly, and they can drown in only a few centimetres of water. Also,
drowning can be very quick – 20 seconds is all it takes. And young children can drown silently,
without coughing or splashing, so you might not even realise they’re in danger.

Constant supervision is the key to drowning prevention.
