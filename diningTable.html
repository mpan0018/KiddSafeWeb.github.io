                    Check for sharp edges and corners where children could bang heads or injure their eyes. Install protective guards or cushioning.
                    Secure all knobs and handles.
                    Seal off all electrical outlets with safety plugs.
                    Keep floor skid-proof. Use nonskid rugs. Wipe up spills immediately.
                    Install safety latches on all cabinets and cupboards with contents that could pose risks to children.
                    Keep spices out of children's reach. Many are toxic.
                    Use a child-resistant garbage can or keep your trash behind closed doors in a locked cabinet.
                    Dispose of plastic bags safely by tying each in a knot before throwing it in the trash.
                    Keep aluminum foil, waxed paper, and plastic wrap dispensers away from children. The serrated edges on the boxes can cut little fingers.

    Make sure stoves, ovens, and burners are in good working order. If fueled by gas, regularly check that there are no leaks and that the pilot lights function properly.
    Use back burners whenever possible. Some of the most common accidents occur when a child reaches up and grabs a pot or pan, spilling the hot contents over himself. When it's necessary to use the front burners, turn all pot handles toward the back so they are not as easy to reach.
    Keep flammable objects such as curtains, towels, oven mitts and debris away from the stove.
    Make sure handles on pots and pans are secure, not loose. Tighten them if they are wobbly, or if they can't be fixed, throw the pots and pans out.
