                    Garages are designed to be a home’s most functional space. Depending on lifestyle and preference, garage space can be utilized for several purposes apart from just storing your vehicle. Garages are active spaces, so therefore, there’s a lot of effort and diligence required to keep them safe. Apart from housing cars, a garage is a home’s storage facility, often containing a host of assorted hazardous substances, such as oils, lubricants, paint, cans, flammable chemicals, and tools.

    For most people, their garage partly acts as a storage room where they store their fluids such as paints, lubricants, fuel, and many more. Avoid storing your products haphazardly. If you have leftover fluid and decide to store it in food or soda bottles, make sure they have large fonts labeling.

It's also important to check where you store your fluids and chemicals; some may erode when placed in mismatched containers causing liquid or fume leaks that may accidentally poison your pets, cause burns, respiratory problems, or even become a potential fire hazard. Children are adventurous; therefore, ensure your chemicals are stored in a high, unreachable space.
