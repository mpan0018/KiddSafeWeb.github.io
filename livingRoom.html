                    You can go a long way in protecting your children by conducting a room-by-room safety check. Follow our guide to learn the simple changes you can make to turn your home into a baby-safe zone.

Make sure the crib has a firm mattress and doesn't include decorative cutouts or corner posts.
Keep pillows, fluffy comforters, and even soft stuffed animals out of the crib in the first four to six months of life -- these can suffocate baby.
Make sure your baby's changing table has three raised sides and a restraining strap.

    Make sure the crib or playpen slats are narrow, and don't leave enough space for your child's head to get wedged between them.
Once your baby's up on all fours and reaching for things, take down decorations or toys that are strung across the crib from rail to rail.
Don't buy a toy box with a heavy hinged lid -- it might fall on your child when he reaches in to get a toy.
Furnish the room with a soft carpet to prevent injury from those unavoidable falls.
