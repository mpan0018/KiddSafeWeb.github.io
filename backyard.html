                    Always supervise outdoor play: Young children should always have a responsible adult outside with them to supervise safe outdoor play.
Install a fence: Children and pets are safer inside of a fenced yard. They'll be less likely to run into the front yard and away from the street.
Lock backyard gates: Keep children and pets in and deter intruders with a locking gate.
Establish boundaries: If you don't have a fenced backyard, teach your child the boundaries in which they can play. Strictly enforce them.
Lock pet doors: Pet doors are convenient for small animals -- and small children. Lock your pet doors to avoid letting small children crawl through them.

    Identify poisonous plants: Plants are a common cause of poisoning among young children. Identify all plants in your backyard and remove or fence in any that are poisonous to children or pets.
Educate children on edible plants: Teach children not to pick and eat anything off of plants. Explain the difference between wild plants and a vegetable garden.
Follow lawn care instructions carefully: If you use a pesticide, herbicide, or lawn service, be sure to read the instructions. Many recommend not allowing children to play on a treated lawn for two days or more. Always wear protective clothing and eye protection while applying pesticides and wash your hands afterward. Alternatively, consider fighting pests naturally.
